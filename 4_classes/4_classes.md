### 1. classes(I)
#### 1.1 Constructs
* This constructor function is declared just like a regular member function, 
  but with a name that matches the class name and without any return type; not even ***void***
* Constructors cannot be called explicitly as if they were regular member functions

#### 1.2 Overloading constructors
* The ***default constructor*** is the constructor that takes no parameters, and it is special
  because it is called when an object is declared but is not initialized with any arguments.
  
#### 1.3 Member initialization in constructors
 
#### 1.4 Pointers to classes

### 2. classes(II)
#### 2.1 Overloading operators
* C++ allows most operators to be overloaded so that their behavior can be defined for
  just about any type, inlcuding classes.
